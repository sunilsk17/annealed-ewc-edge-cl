# Keep Mac Awake Command

## In a SEPARATE terminal, run this:

```bash
caffeinate -d -i -s -t 10000
```

**What this does**:
- Keeps Mac awake for 10,000 seconds (~2.8 hours)
- `-d`: Display won't sleep
- `-i`: System won't idle
- `-s`: System won't sleep
- `-t 10000`: Run for 10,000 seconds

**This is SEPARATE from the training** - just keeps your Mac active!

---

## To stop it:
Press `Ctrl+C` in that terminal when training is done.

---

**Run this in a NEW terminal window now!**
